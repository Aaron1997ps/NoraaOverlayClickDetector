This is a twitch extention which you can find here
https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/qillvtd91t2sywoxafyag186blg8jy-0.0.1

I encourage people to update the repo as they see fit.

# Description
This extention sends webhook data to an external self-hosted website. To do this, your website needs to be "Allowlist for URL Fetching Domains", which I need to add myself. Please email Aaron1997ps@gmail.com with your domain so it can be added to the list

# Fork Credit
